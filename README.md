# it's javi!

not a whole lot to say about me

i use [GDevelop 5](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop)! an open-source no-code game engine, making an rpg game with paper mario like battle mechanics\
i dont really go deep into actual coding unless needed, i know a bit of python and html, but just the basics.\
i make music and art sometimes

i do have one game that is publicly available you can try out! (spoiler: it's awful)

## GAIDO PETTO
![image](https://github.com/JavierHD806/JavierHD806/assets/16809187/eeb1d9ac-488c-40be-bcbf-22f50c0cac34)\
meaning "guide pet" in japanese, „Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ „Éö„ÉÉ„Éà\
name was chosen becaues it kinda rhymed :)

decided to join a game jam so i could make a small project to test out the waters of gdevelop,\
this means that the current build available is RIDDLED with BUGS\
i planned to fix these bugs and make a full game after the game jam, but i never ended up doing so\
id love to get back to this, but im not sure when or if i will\
p.s. the game isn't actually all that fun! you do like three things over the course of 10 minutes with a really bad ending to the game\
p.p.s. i WOULD make the game open-source, but i took a look at the coding and it's actually sort of kinda AWFUL, maybe some other time
