# it's javi!

not a whole lot to say about me

i mainly use [GDevelop 5](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop)! an open-source no-code game engine\
i used to make an rpg game with paper mario like battle mechanics, however ive moved onto making smaller titles\
i dont really go deep into actual coding unless needed, i know a bit of python, html, and c++ but just the basics.\
i make music and art sometimes too!

i do have two games that are publicly available you can try out! (spoiler: it's awful)

## GAIDO PETTO
![image](https://github.com/JavierHD806/JavierHD806/assets/16809187/eeb1d9ac-488c-40be-bcbf-22f50c0cac34)\
meaning "guide pet" in japanese, „Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ „Éö„ÉÉ„Éà\
name was chosen becaues it kinda rhymed :)

decided to join a game jam so i could make a small project to test out the waters of gdevelop,\
this means that the current build available is RIDDLED with BUGS\
i planned to fix these bugs and make a full game after the game jam, but i never ended up doing so\
id love to get back to this, and flesh it out more!!\
p.s. the game isn't actually all that fun! you do like three things over the course of 10 minutes with a really bad ending to the game\

### Description
<strong>As Mr. Gaido, you take care of your neighbor's pet, who as gone off for vacation for the rest of the week!
‚ÄúGuide‚Äù your pet to living until the 7th day!</strong>

## CRUDE FOOD
![dbbncE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ec3777-c7cf-493f-b391-741a336c799f)
name was chosen becaues it also kinda rhymed :)

made for a small game jam between friends\
i like to think it's a bit more polished than GAIDO PETTO\

### Description
<strong>you are a secretly evil guy!
you don't have a mouth
therefore, you make bad food for people WITH mouths.
to get revenge!!
but you cant make the food too bad or else some people will GET you.
but if you arent evil enough, you will DIE.

feed the people labeled "IMPORTANT" their correct order!!
feed everyone else an incorrect order to fill up your evil meter!
try to max out your evil meter at the end of the day (5pm) to keep going!

good luck :D</strong>
